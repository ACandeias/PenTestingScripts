    .SYNOPSIS
        A script to sweep the local subnet.
    .DESCRIPTION
        This script will sweep the local subnet for active computers. If a computer
        responds to a ping request, it is considered active and a portscan is done
        on some common Windows TCP ports.
        
        The following data is returned as part of the script.
            Name      : The hostname of the computer
            IPAddress : The IP address of the computer
            MAC       : The Mac Address of the computer
            PortList  : The list of open ports
        
        This data is all returned as an object suitable for piping into and out
        of various cmdlets.
    .PARAMETER Range
        This is the 4th octect in the range of IP's to sweep.
    .PARAMETER Subnet
        This is the Subnet ID portion of the IP range.
    .PARAMETER Ports
        This is a listing of ports to check on the remote machine to see if a
        connection can be established.
